# Rate Limit Policy

Rate limiting is an essential mechanism in API management that restricts the number of requests a client can send to an API within a given time frame. The primary purpose of rate limiting is to prevent clients from overloading the API and causing system downtime, poor performance, or even complete failure.

Refer [Manage Rate Limiting](../../create-api/rate-limiting/rate-limiting-policy-overview/) for more information on how to configure ratelimiting with API.
