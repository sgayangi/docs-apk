Follow the instructions below to deploy APK Data Service (DS) servers and the Cloud Native Postgres(CloudNativePG) in the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Create a new helm repository with the latest apk release using the following command. Letâ€™s consider the ```<repository-name>``` as ```wso2apk``` for this guide.

    === "Command"
        ```
        helm repo add wso2apk https://github.com/wso2/apk/releases/download/1.0.0-rc2
        ```
    === "Format"
        ```
        helm repo add <repository-name> <link-to-latest-apk-release>
        ```
	
2. Execute the following command to update the helm repositories.

      ```console
      helm repo update
      ```

3. Install the APK components and start WSO2 API Platform For Kubernetes. Consider ```apk``` as the ```<chart-name>``` for this guide. As the ```--version``` of this command, use the version of the release you used in point 1 above. It will take a few minutes for the deployment to complete.

    === "Command"
        ```
        helm install apk wso2apk/apk-helm --version 1.0.0-rc2
        ```

    === "Format"
        ```
        helm install <chart-name> <repository-name>/apk-helm --version <verison-of-APK>
        ```
	
    !!!Optional
    
        To commence the installation while making use of the customization       capabilities inherent in the `values.yaml` file, follow the subsequent command format. Instructions in [Customize Configurations](../setup/Customize-Configurations.md) will guide you through the process of acquiring the `values.yaml` file.
        === "Command"
            ```
            helm install apk wso2apk/apk-helm --version 1.0.0-rc2 -f values.yaml
            ```

        === "Format"
            ```
            helm install <chart-name> <repository-name>/apk-helm --version <verison-of-APK> -f <path-to-values.yaml-file>
            ```

4. Now you can verify the deployment by executing the following command. You will see the status of the pods as follows once completed.

    === "Command"
        ```
        kubectl get pods
        ```

    !!! Important
        If pods are not transitioning to running state, please follow the steps in the [FAQs](../../about-apk/FAQs/#q3-why-are-pods-not-transitioning-to-the-running-state-for-a-long-time) to troubleshoot the problem.
